# linux-service-monitor
The script will monitor your services, and will start it if it is not running.

You can add your service process in processes array and service name in service name in services array.

You can also modify sleepSecs to decide your check interval.

If you don't just save message in the log, you can send email or do something.

I hope this script is useful to you.
